This repo has two product surfaces only:
- Admin (Filament / Lunar Panel)
- Frontend (Livewire)

Global naming rules:
- Do NOT create new folders, namespaces, views, translations, or route names containing "Storefront"/"storefront".
- Frontend routes MUST use the `frontend.*` name prefix.
- Admin routes MUST use the `admin.*` name prefix.

Foldering + namespaces:
- Admin code lives in `app/Admin/**` (namespace `App\Admin\...`).
- Frontend page/UI code lives in:
  - `app/Livewire/Frontend/**` (namespace `App\Livewire\Frontend\...`)
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Frontend/**` (namespace `App\Http\Controllers\Frontend\...`) for endpoints/actions (JSON, POST actions, downloads, etc.)
  - `app/View/Components/Frontend/**` (namespace `App\View\Components\Frontend\...`) for Blade components.

Views:
- Frontend Blade views live in `resources/views/frontend/**`.
- Frontend Livewire views live in `resources/views/livewire/frontend/**`.
- Admin views live in `resources/views/admin/**`.
- Blade component views:
  - `resources/views/components/frontend/**`
  - `resources/views/components/admin/**`

Livewire-only frontend rule:
- New frontend *pages* must be Livewire components (prefer `app/Livewire/Frontend/Pages/**`) and be routed directly in `routes/web.php` as `Route::get(..., SomePage::class)`.
- Avoid adding new frontend GET page controllers. Use controllers for non-page concerns only (webhooks, JSON endpoints, downloads, POST/PUT/DELETE actions).

Translations:
- Frontend translations live in `resources/lang/<locale>/frontend.php` and are accessed via `__('frontend...')`.

Session:
- Use `App\Lunar\FrontendSession\FrontendSessionHelper` for app-level currency/language/session state.
- `App\Http\Middleware\FrontendSessionMiddleware` is the default web middleware for initializing the frontend session.

When making refactors:
- Prefer `git mv` for moves/renames to preserve history.
- After large renames, run a search to ensure no legacy "storefront" references remain (excluding vendor URLs if present).
